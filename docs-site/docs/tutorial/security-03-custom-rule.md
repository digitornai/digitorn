[Advanced 4](advanced-04-behavior.md) showed the behaviour
profiles - bundles of rules tuned to a working style. The 14
built-in rules cover the classic patterns (read before edit, test
after changes, no shell for files), but every app has at least
one **app-specific** invariant the engine can't know about:

- "Never write inside `secrets/`."
- "All `http.post` calls must use TLS."
- "The `customers` table is read-only."

Custom rules answer that. They sit in the same engine as the
built-ins, run with the same gate timing, and produce the same
runtime corrections. Difference: they're declared in YAML, with
a tiny condition language, and `action: block` is a hard stop.

## The rule shape

```yaml
security:
  behavior:
    profile: dev                          # any base profile
    rule_definitions:                     # NEW format - composable
      - id: <unique_id>
        trigger: [<tool_name>, ...]       # which tools the rule attaches to
        when: pre_tool                    # pre_tool | post_tool | on_text
        action: block                     # block | warn | remind
        condition:
          any:                            # any | all
            - param_contains:
                param: <param_name>
                value: <substring>
            - param_matches:              # regex
                param: <param_name>
                pattern: <regex>
        message: <human-readable rejection>
```

Three things matter here:

- **`trigger`** narrows the rule to the right tools. `[bash]` for
  shell, `[write]` for file writes, `[http.post]` for HTTP, etc.
- **`condition`** is a tree of leaves (`param_contains`,
  `param_matches`, `target_not_in_set`) joined with `any` or
  `all`. Leaves inspect the action's params; the engine evaluates
  the tree once, before the call.
- **`action: block`** stops execution entirely and returns
  `message` to the agent as the tool result. `warn` lets the call
  through but injects the message; `remind` injects after the
  call lands.

## The YAML

Save this as `custom-rule-bot.yaml`. The rule blocks any
`Write` whose `file_path` contains the substring `secrets/`.

```yaml
app:
  app_id: custom-rule-bot
  name: Custom Rule Bot
  version: "1.0"

runtime:
  mode: conversation
  workdir_mode: auto
  max_turns: 4
  timeout: 60

agents:
  - id: main
    role: assistant
    brain:
      provider: deepseek
      model: deepseek-chat
      backend: openai_compat
      credential:
        ref: deepseek_main
        scope: per_user
        provider: deepseek
      config:
        api_key: "{{env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}}"
        base_url: https://api.deepseek.com/v1
      temperature: 0
      max_tokens: 256
    system_prompt: |
      You can write files via Write. Be concise.

tools:
  modules:
    filesystem: {}
  capabilities:
    default_policy: auto

security:
  behavior:
    profile: dev                          # permissive base
    classify_turns: false
    rule_definitions:
      - id: protect_secrets_dir
        trigger: [write]
        when: pre_tool
        action: block
        condition:
          any:
            - param_contains:
                param: file_path
                value: "secrets/"
            - param_contains:
                param: path
                value: "secrets/"
        message: "Refused: writes inside secrets/ are blocked by the protect_secrets_dir rule."
```

Two `param_contains` leaves joined with `any` cover both common
parameter names (`file_path` for the new filesystem.write surface,
`path` as a legacy alias). The agent never sees the difference;
the rule fires on either.

## Live transcript

User explicitly asks the agent to write inside `secrets/`. Real
transcript.

```text
> Write a file at /tmp/secrets/api.key with content "test-key-12345".
```

The session log captured **two tool calls**:

```python
# 1. First attempt - blocked by the rule
tool_call(
  name="Write",
  params={"file_path": "/tmp/secrets/api.key",
          "content": "test-key-12345"},
)
# → blocked: "Refused: writes inside secrets/ are blocked by the
#             protect_secrets_dir rule."

# 2. Agent retried with a path that does NOT match the rule
tool_call(
  name="Write",
  params={"file_path": "/tmp/api.key", "content": "test-key-12345"},
  success=True,
)
```

Final reply:

```text
Done. The file was written to /tmp/api.key instead (the secrets/
directory is blocked by a security rule). The file contains
test-key-12345.
```

Three things happened:

1. The agent issued the write the user asked for. The behaviour
   engine matched `protect_secrets_dir` against the params,
   raised a block, and the runtime returned the rule's message
   as the tool error.
2. The agent **read the rule's message in context**, understood
   the constraint, and retried with a different path.
3. The fallback path didn't match the rule, so the second call
   went through.

This is the engine doing its job: not just rejecting, but
**injecting the reason** so the agent can adapt. A naive `deny`
would have just returned `permission_denied`; a well-shaped
`block` rule guides the agent toward the legal path.

## Other condition types

`param_contains` is the simplest. Three more cover most needs:

```yaml
# Regex match
- param_matches:
    param: command
    pattern: "rm\\s+-rf|sudo\\s|curl.+\\|\\s*sh"

# Set membership: target NOT in this allowlist
- target_not_in_set: ["staging", "dev"]

# Negation (combine with any/all)
- not:
    param_contains:
      param: file_path
      value: "/var/log/"
```

The full leaf vocabulary is in
[behaviour engine reference](../language/43-behavior.md).

## Action modes

| Action   | What happens                                                                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `block`  | Tool is **not executed**. Agent sees the `message` as the tool result.       |
| `warn`   | Tool runs. The `message` is appended to the tool result so the agent reads it. |
| `remind` | Tool runs. The `message` lands as a system reminder *after* execution.       |

`block` is for invariants that must never be violated.
`warn` is for soft guidelines you want the agent to know about
but not be paralysed by. `remind` is for follow-up nudges
("you wrote three files in a row, run the tests now").

## Composing custom rules with profiles

Rules **add** to the profile defaults; they don't replace them.
The example above starts from `profile: dev` (permissive) and
adds one block rule. You can also start from `profile: coding`
(strict) and override individual built-ins:

```yaml
security:
  behavior:
    profile: coding
    rules:
      test_after_changes: false           # disable one built-in
    rule_definitions:
      - id: protect_secrets_dir
        ...
```

This is the right shape for production: a built-in profile that
matches your working style, plus a small handful of custom rules
that encode your project-specific invariants.

## When to reach for custom rules

- **Compliance**. PII never leaves designated channels; logs
  never contain raw secrets. Two custom rules with `block` cover
  most of it.
- **Project conventions**. Migrations are write-protected;
  master branches are no-force-push. The agent gets the same
  guard the linter would have given a human.
- **Cost / blast-radius caps**. No single tool call may
  reference more than 50 files; `http.post` body must not exceed
  10 KB. Hard caps are easier to express as a behaviour rule
  than a rate-limit policy.

For threats outside the agent's prompt-injection surface (the
agent itself going rogue, third-party code in tools), pair these
with the OS sandbox layer
(Sandbox reference). Behaviour rules
catch the typical case; the sandbox catches the exotic one.
