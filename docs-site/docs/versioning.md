# Versioning and stability

Digitorn ships under semantic versioning at the package level
(`go.mod`) and an explicit YAML language version
(`schema_version`).

## YAML schema version

The Digitorn YAML language ships in versioned schemas. There are
two:

- **`schema_version: 2`** - the canonical 8-block shape
  documented in [Language](language/). All new apps target this.
- **`schema_version: 1`** - the legacy flat shape (`execution:`,
  `modules:` at the top level, ...). Still accepted: an alias
  pass reshapes it to v2 before validation, so every legacy YAML
  keeps parsing.

When `schema_version` is omitted the compiler auto-detects the
shape. Setting it explicitly future-proofs the file against
breaking changes.

### What "frozen" means (schema v2)

For the lifetime of `schema_version: 2`:

- **No required field is added.** Every existing YAML keeps
  parsing without modification.
- **No required field is removed.** Every field documented under
  [Language](language/) keeps doing what it did.
- **No field type is narrowed.** A field that accepts a string
  today won't reject the same string after an upgrade.
- **Default values are stable.** If a field's default changed, the
  daemon would emit a deprecation warning and honour the previous
  default for at least one minor release.

### What CAN change

- **New optional fields.** A new YAML key under any block, with a
  safe default, can land in any release.
- **New modules.** New entries are added to `tools.modules.<id>`.
  Existing modules don't go away without deprecation.
- **New `runtime.mode` values.** Adding modes is backward-compat;
  removing is not.
- **New CLI sub-commands.** `digitorn ...` grows over time.
- **Internal implementation.** Everything inside the daemon -
  the SQL schema, the IPC protocol between worker and child
  processes, the cache file layout - is internal and may change
  in any release.

### Deprecation policy

A field deprecated in `1.X.0` continues to work and emit a
warning. It is removed no sooner than `1.(X+2).0`. Deprecations
are listed in the release notes published with each minor.

`schema_version: 1` itself is a deprecation umbrella: the alias
pass keeps it alive but every legacy field has a `schema_version: 2`
The compiler handles v1→v2 migration automatically
one-shot migration.

## Daemon version

	The daemon's own version follows SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
	Breaking changes to internal APIs (the module surface, the
	internal HTTP routes, the Socket.IO event payload shape if a
	widely-deployed client depends on it) increment the MAJOR version.
The public REST API
([reference(daemon API).md](reference(daemon API).md)) is the contract:
breaking changes there are reflected as new versioned routes
(`(daemon API)...`) before the old ones are removed.

## Schema version field

The optional `schema_version` declaration at the top of a YAML
file is a *forward-compat* signal:

```yaml
schema_version: 2
```

When set, the alias pass that converts legacy v1 flat shape to
v2 canonical is skipped (the YAML is already v2). This is the
canonical form: new apps should always set it.

When `schema_version` is absent, the alias pass auto-detects the
shape and applies the v1 → v2 reshape before validation. This is
how every legacy YAML keeps working without modification.

## Migrating from legacy flat shape

The migration table is in
[the language reference](/docs/language/#migration-from-the-legacy-flat-shape).
The CLI does the rewrite for you:

```bash
The compiler rewrites legacy YAML to the canonical v2 shape
```

This is a one-time, in-place rewrite. It is safe: the YAML
remains valid before and after, and the app's runtime behaviour
is identical (the alias pass produces the same compiled output).

## Module API

A module implements the Module interface and exposes action methods.
The action signature (`description, tool_prompt,
risk_level, hidden, params_model, ...`) is part of the
`schema_version: 2` contract.

Module-internal helpers (anything not exposed as an action or via
constraints) is implementation detail and may
move between releases.
