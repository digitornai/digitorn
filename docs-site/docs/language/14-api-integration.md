The HTTP API surface, the OAuth flows for per-app
integrations, and the credentials manifest endpoints are
**not part of the public documentation contract**.

Public clients use the SDKs and CLI:

- **Native CLI** - `digitorn chat <app-id>`
- **React Preview SDK** - [preview-sdk](47-preview-sdk.md)
- **CLI** - [cli reference](../reference/cli/)

The live event stream over Socket.IO is the one transport
contract documented for direct use:
[Socket.IO Protocol](../reference/api/socketio.md).

For direct HTTP integration outside of the SDKs, contact your
daemon administrator.
