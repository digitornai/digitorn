title: How-tos
---

Task-oriented recipes. Each page is structured as
**problem -> minimal YAML -> deploy + verify**, with the live test
command included. Where a recipe touches a module, the page links
to the full module reference instead of repeating it.

## Standalone how-tos

| Recipe                                           | Page                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| Attach files to a chat session (paperclip menu)  | [Attach files to chat](attach-files-to-chat.md)     |
| Install an MCP server (Hub catalog or custom)    | [Install an MCP server](install-an-mcp-server.md)   |

## Linked recipes

Topics where the canonical reference page is already exhaustive;
the howto would just be a copy. Follow the links instead.

## When to write a howto

Write a howto when:

- The task crosses 3+ pages of the reference and you want a single
  copy-pasteable answer.
- The task has a non-obvious gotcha (an order-of-operations,
  a credential scope, a sandbox interaction).
- A user asks the same question twice on the issue tracker.

A howto is **NOT** the place for new conceptual material. If the
recipe needs a paragraph of "why", that paragraph belongs in
[Concepts](/docs/concepts/) and the howto links to it.
